# Stand alone components 

- Idea is to work without modules.
- Introduced in Angular 14+
- Its introduced in Preview mode for V14. So the syntax can change later. With V15, its stable. 
- That doesnt mean, we should use this in production ready apps.

- Standard apps have one problem - Boilerplate code.
- It makes refactoring painful.
- Angular modules help organize & structure the code, but it comes with its own boilerplates.
- To get rid of ngModules, angular brought Standalone modules.

[Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ag5ado?file=src%2Fmain.ts)

The new mode ( in preview ) can be mixed with old way.

- In a regular component, add special flag `standalone: true` to the configuration of component.
- If we mark a component as standalone, then do not register the component in any modules.
- We must still let angular know of this component. 
- Go to the component where this component is used, add imports: [DetailsComponent]
- or go to the AppModule, instead of adding the stand alone components to declarations, we add it to imports.
- StandAlone directive is possible. ( standalone: true )
- In stand alone component, we can add imports: [SharedModule] 
- In AppComponent, if we add standalone to true, which is the root component,  we need to change the main.ts to point to the component.

```js
// platform browser 
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    // AnalyticsService,
    importProvidersFrom(AppRoutingModule)
  ],

})
```

Services:

- We have providedIn root set to service. If not, we can add a providers: [] within component decorator. But we wont get same instance then. 
- Register the services within the bootstrapApplication as above if we have not used providedIn root.

Routing :

- We need to let application / app component know about router module.
- imports: [RouterModule] within the component configuration, also, RoutingModule needs to be registered.
- We add lazy loading as well.

[Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ag5ado?file=src%2Fmain.ts)

Right now, this is just an alternative. Angular has not highlighted this as the default recommended way.
