# Custom Directives 

Building our own custom directives.

- Custom directives are means by which we grab the real DOM and make changes on top of it.
- Here, in this example below, we create a directive, which in turn grabs the element on which it sits, and exposes that to the directive logic to be tweaked // modified from within.
- Similarly, we can listens to events on the element as well. 
- Where it becomes handy is like, if we need to create reusable piece of functionality, for ef: A box shadow over a card conditionally.

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngdocs-08-xedtc1?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhighlight.directive.ts)


- Direct Dom access isnt recommended though.
- We can use the renderer to grab DOM the angular way.
- We use something called renderer who makes sure, the DOm is grabbed via an intermediate construct capable of handling platform variations
- eg: If the code runs in server where there is no DOM, direct DOM manipulations will break the app.

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngdocs-08-nv7gd7?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhighlight.directive.ts)


### Why renderer?

- Angular is not limited to running in browser. 
- It works with service workers.
- If we try to run the code in an environment that doesnt support it, app throws error.

### HostListener & HostBinding

With HostListener, we can listen to any events happening in the element.
With HostBinding, we bind the properties dynamically on to the host. ( eg: add/remove classes or styles )

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngdocs-08-mdbuhx?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhighlight.directive.ts)

```js
  
  // detect click anywhere in the DOM 
  @HostListener('document:click', ['$event']) toggleOpen(event: Event) {
    this.isOpen = this.elRef.nativeElement.contains(event.target) ? !this.isOpen : false;
  }
```
If we need to conditionally attach / detach attributes like class, style etc, we use HostBinding, 
which is nothing but "binding to the host element's property"

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngdocs-08-wbyz6v?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhighlight.directive.ts)

### To pass in custom values & alias

```js
@Input() default = 'green';
@Input() highlighted = 'pink';

@HostListener('mouseenter') mouseover() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(
      this.elementRef.nativeElement,
      'background-color',
      this.default
    );
  }

  @HostListener('mouseleave') mouseleave() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(
      this.elementRef.nativeElement,
      'background-color',
      this.highlighted
    );
  }
```
and use them as 

```html 
<h1 appHighlight [default]="'blue'" [highlighted]="'gold'">Custom Directive</h1>
```

For alias values 

```js 
@Input('appHighlight') highlighted = 'pink';
```
and we bind the value directly to the directive

```html
<h1 [appHighlight]="'gold'" [default]="'blue'">Custom Directive</h1>
```

### Behind scenes - Structural directives 

Angular transforms the structural directives (eg: `*ngIf` ) into 

```
<ng-template [ngIf]="condition">
 
</ng-template>
```

### Custom structual directive 

```js
import { Directive, ElementRef, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appUnless]',
})
export class UnlessDirective implements OnInit {
  @Input() set appUnless(condition: boolean) {
   if(!condition) {
     this.vcRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef) 
   } else {
      this.vcRef.clear()
   }
  }
  constructor(private templateRef: TemplateRef<any>, private vcRef: ViewContainerRef) {

  }
}
```
and use it as `<div *appUnless="condition"> </div>`

### Explanation

Since we need to conditionally add / remove from DOM, we need access to the view container, which is the div into which the content will be added/removed, for which we use the `ViewContainerRef`
To pass in the template that is inserted, we need to have access to the template which we grab via `TemplateRef`.

eg: If we need to put apples into the basket or pick apple from the basket, 
- ViewContainerRef is the basket 
- TemplateRef is the apple.
