# Observables

- Basically a data source. ( user input events, http requests, triggered in code). 
- Observable can handle data, error, completion. These are the 3 types of data we receive.
- Even if we change the tab / destroy the component , the subscription is still alive. SO it can cause memory leaks if left unsubscribed.
- Can do more with operators that it provides.
- An observable is a construct that needs to be subscribed inorder for it to emit data.
- With operators, we can transform the data to something else. 
- If not handled, causes memory leak. 

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-qhmk7k?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts)

```js 
// another angular example for observables
this.route.queryParams.subscribe((params) => {
 console.log(params)
})
```

### Operators 

- are of various categories. Make sure, you are not using deprecated operators. Using this will break the code if angular and rxjs is not updated 
- eg: combineAll (deprecated)
- combination
- conditional
- creation
- error handling 
- multicasting
- filtering 
- transformation

### Note:

- The most important thing is not to be overwhelmed, not to freak out, but use docs as a means to get the operator you want.
- No one will by heart this 100+ operators.
- Use right operators for the right scenario.

eg: combineLatest will not emit an initial value until each observable emits atleast one value.
If we work with observables that only emit one value, or we only need the last emitted value, then forkJoin is the better option.

Important ones to keep in mind

- combineLatest
- zip 
- forkJoin 
- merge 
- startWith 
- withLatestFrom 
- from, of, fromEvent 
- catch/catchError
- shareReplay  
- distinctUntilChanged 
- distinctUntilKeyChanged 
- take
- takeUntil 
- concatMap
- switchMap
- exhaustMap 
- mergeMap
- tap

### Create observables from scratch 

```js 
ngOnInit() {
    const myObs = Observable.create( (observer: Observer<string>) => {
      setTimeout( () => {
        observer.next('first package')
      }, 2000)

      setTimeout( () => {
        observer.next('second package')
      }, 4000)

      setTimeout( () => {
        observer.error('Something is wrong')
      }, 5000)
    })

    myObs.subscribe(
      (data:string) => console.log(data),
      (err) => console.log(err),
      () => console.log("completed!")
    )
  }

```

### Subject to pass and listen to data 

- we import them from rxjs
- we use next/subscribe to emit and listen to them 
- In component, we need to unsubscribe them though.
- We use them for cross component communication involving services.
- BehaviorSubject needs an initial set of value.
