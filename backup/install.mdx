# Installing Angular CLI & walkthrough

- to create project, we do not build from scratch. 
- we rely on a build tool that converts typescript to javascript, Scss compilers, build optimizations, 
- compress the code, minify, uglify, the code. 
- cli helps the process of building angular apps. 
- [Installation docs](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local)

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

If using mac, you may need to use `sudo` at the start
If you are within a office/corporate environment, you may need admin rights to do the same.

### Need for a CLI 

Why cli? The source code is build, Typescript is compiled to javascript and spins up a dev server. Double clicking index.html and opening up will only have a file protocol and we need a lot of dynamic compiling and we need to simulate how it looks in a real app only if we have the http protocol. For those, we need cli tooling, which does the heavy lifting. CLI does optimizations behind scenes to give a bundle for respective environments.

### To create an angular application

```
ng new my-app-name

```
It will ask the following questions

- Add routing? : **No**
- Stylesheet   : **css/Less/Sass/Scss**
- SSR / SSG?   : **No**

Once the installation is done, `cd` into the folder & run the app by the command `ng serve` and the application will be
up and running in port 4200 by default.

The bundle values which we see changes depending on when you are seeing this.
As angular is iteratively improved, optimizations provided will keep the bundle sizes even smaller.
 
Open the browser under this url

```
http://localhost:4200/
```

The home page will look something like this. It may change depending on when you see this though.

If you open the "View Page Source", it should look something like this

![view page source](/images/page-source.png)

which if you wonder, doesnt look like the screenshot you saw as the landing page.
This is what SPA does. The initial load just bring in this much only, and the whole application is rendered within `<app-root></app-root>` tag which you see above. See the explanation of the same in the next section.
