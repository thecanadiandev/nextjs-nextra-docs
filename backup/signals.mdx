# Signals

- Added with Angular 16 as a developer preview.
- Likely to be stable by 17 
- A new way of handling data changes & UI updates.
- Without this, angular relies on classic change detection. ( zone.js )
- In a traditional app, data is changed by setting properties & updating them. Changes are detected automatically with classic approach.
- Downside - Performance could be better, and bundle size needs to be decreased.
- Alternate way of detecting changes without extra library.
- Stop watching the entire app. There is no automatic change detection, and we as a developer, tell angular when data changes, and where its used in UI.
- Full control, better performance, smaller bundle. With 16, we cannot fully switch to signals.
- To get the full benefits, we need an app that runs fully on signals. 
- As of now, signals are brand new and needs a few more releases to be stable and evolve fully.
