# Ngrx 

- State management system / library
- 3rd party library created by same team 
- A package, that helps manage app wide state 
- Complex apps.
- State changes over time 
- Instead of managing state in components & services, we manage them outside of them.
- Clearly defined approach to manage state 
- Store is a centralized virtual javascript object, where data is stored & managed. Component reads data from store & can listen to changes in store.
- Selectors can help get respective slices for component 
- To change data, dispatch actions to store which is picked up by reducer who mutates state for the store.
- Effects are side effects ( anything async is handled here, like HTTP requests )

### Effects 

- side effects
- anything that is not directly related to Ui update 
- avoid them in reducers, which should be pure. 
- `ng add @ngrx/effects`
