# Angular 

- is 2 things. A front end JS framework. 
- helps us build advanced feature rich & highly interactive web UIs
- Also a collection of tools & features ( CLI, Debugging tools, IDE plugins)

## Why framework? 

- Simplify the process of building complex, interactive web UIs.
- GIves us fetaures, rules 
- Helps us write Declarative code instead of imperative. 
- Seperation of concerns via components which is custom HTML elements ( HTMl + CSS + JS )
- Build a component once and re-use it. 
- Better development process.
- OOPS concepts & principles.
- Uses typescript.
- what we write is TS, not JS.

## Evolution 

- Evolving framework, 
- 2016 - Angular 2 was released. Every year, 2 new versions will come out. 
- Good backward compatibility.
- A good amount of company still works with older versions. 
- With 14 & 15, Standalone components was released.
- With 16, Signals was released. 

## Scaffolding 

- CLI simplify the process. 
- VS code can be a good editor. 
- Angular language service extension + Angular essentials are extra installations.

```js 
sudo npm i -g @angular/cli 
Node js is a pre requisites. CLI needs node to work properly. 

ng new app-name 
npm start
```

## Angular essentials. 

- Components, templates, services & more. 
- Folder structure walkthrough, main.ts, package.json 
- Bootstrap flow: The app root is the only component in index.html 
- The `bootstrapApplication` is looking for the component, and looks for its selector in index.html 
- standalone set to true means the component is a stand alone component. 

[Creating and registering new component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-pfszxv?file=src%2Fmain.ts)
- Make sure, `standalone` is true. 
- We also have module based components. ( older module based approach )
- imports + standalone works together. 
- It adds the components to the tree. 
- To add images from assets folder, look for 

```js 
"assets": [
    "src/assets"
]

// or 

"assets": [
    "src/assets", // add it here.
    {
        glob: "**/*"
    }
]

// and in template 

<img src="assets/task-mgmt-logo.png"/>

we used src/assets/ to add our logo.
```

To scaffold components with cli, inside app, we can create a folder name and put the files in it. 
`ng g c user`

In VS Code, if you click the bulb, its auto imported in the imports array. 


### Bindings in angular 

- We have interpolation/ string binding
- Property or attribute binding ( Property binding wants to target properties, not attributes. So things like aria tags need [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal")
- Event binding 

[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bjgv9f?file=src%2Fuser.component.ts)

### Computed values

- Use getters to evaluate computed values. So basically, as shown below.

```js 
get imagePath() {
    return 'assets/users/' + this.user.url 
}

and to use them, <img [src]="imagePath"
```

### Change detection 

- Zone js was used behind to do change detection. It automatically listens to user events / timers etc and checks the app for possible changes. 
- The moment we update a property, change detction picks it up. 
- This was the way till recently. Works aytomatically, no instructions required. 
- With signals, they are special values that tell angular / notify them about value changes and required UI updates. Support is from angular 16.
- Signals are trackable data containers. It is an object that stores a value and angular will be notified when it changes & angular will be able to update the part of UI that needs updation.

[Signals intro example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-81iznu?file=src%2Fuser.component.ts)

- signals need to be executed. Angular sets up subscriptions behind scenes. So when template value changes, component is re-evaluated.
- Angular sets up a tracking mechanism that makes sure that UI is updated whenever  underlying value changes. 
- With zone js, angular creates zones around components where it listens for all kinds of events that could trigger state changes / data changes . 
- So an invisible grouping around components. 
- When its detected, angular goes and checks all components within that zone to see if some data changed or not & needs UI updation.
- With signals, angular could get rid of zone & change detection and UI updates can be performed more efficiently & fine grained way.
- Rather new. Partially stable by 17. 

[Input / Output example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-yrecpc?file=src%2Fmain.ts)
- In the above example, we used the traditional input and output. 
- With signals, we have another syntax.

### Input & output with signals 
[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jvdtui?file=src%2Fmain.ts)
- keep in mind, input signals are read only & cannot be changed from within with set.
- turns out, we can also use signals for accepting inputs instead of @Input decorator.
- From outside the component, we set the inputs the same only. That doesnt change. The set value can be non-signal too. 
- Type vs interface. Both are fine to be used. interface is more common though. We can name it as model.

### Class binding

```js 
<div [class.active]="currentSelected" />
```

### Modal example 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-4gjcaq?file=src%2Fmodal.component.ts)

### Modal with forms 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-6y7rfk?file=src%2Fmodal.component.ts)


### Content projection with ngContent 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-wkncp6?file=src%2Fmain.ts)

### Pipes 

```js 
import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common'
imports: [DatePipe]
```

- uppercase, lowercase, date, number, currency etc 

### Services 

- keep components lean as possible
- move non UI logic into service 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-5nifxf?file=src%2Fmain.ts)


## Angular essentials - Working with modules 

- Angular 16 or less uses Modules 
- Modules based components vs Stand alone components 

[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-8xudvc?file=src%2Fapp.module.ts)
- if we need to keep them as standalone, then move them to imports array instead of declarations. 
- we can create SharedModule too. Make sure to use exports array. Also, use CommonModule within imports array. 
- For ngModel, we dont need to invoke a signal. Just its reference. 
- we can call asReadonly() on a signal to get a read only version. Computed is another option.

### Debug 

- source maps, breakpoints, angular dev tools, redux dev tools. 

## Components and Templates 

- when to split ?
- seperation of concerns & single responsibility principle. 
- if we put a !, it means the property will never be undefined.


### Slot projection 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-h34yec?file=src%2Fcard.component.ts)

- with select, we can restrict what is being projected into it. 

```js 
<ng-content  select="input, textarea"/>
```

### Scoped styles 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-ggxxwr?file=src%2Fcustom-button.component.ts)
Here, the slot projected styles are not applied unless we set encapsulation to None. 


### Host element 

Note: host wont work when encapsulation is none. 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a4ixr2?file=src%2Fcustom-button.component.ts)
[Example 2](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-uvpe82?file=src%2Fcustom-button.component.ts)

### HostBinding and HostListener within components

[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-uvpe82?file=src%2Fcustom-button.component.ts)


### Dynamically bind class 

```js 
<div [class.active]="isSelected">
<div [class]="{'class1': isSelected, 'class2': isHighlighted }">
<div [style]="{'font-size' : '20px', fontWeight: 'bold'}">
<div [style.fontSize]="'20px'">
```

### Lifecycle 

[Reference](https://angular.dev/guide/components/lifecycle)

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-7h7huf?file=src%2Fcard.component.ts)

### Template variables & ViewChild
 
[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-vyn27k?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts)

- Viewchild/Children only allows us to grab anything which is part of the template.
- Projected content is not a part of it.
- To grab them, we use contentChild/contect children decorators or its function equivalents

```js 
@ContentChild('input') private control: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>

// signal alternative 
private control = contentChild<ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>>('input');
```

### New life cycle hooks 

- AfterViewInit - guarenteed to have access to elements grabbed using view child. It is not available by default on OnInit.
- AfterContentInit - safely access the projected content. 

These two are registered inside constructor

- afterRender 
- afterNextRender 


```js 

constructor() {
    afterRender(() => {
      // Whenever anything changes anywhere in the app, 
      // render a lot of times.
    })

    afterNextRender(() => {
     // after the next change anywhere in the app.
     // only be triggered once for the next change anywhere in the app. 
    })
}

```

With signals, if we use them in the template and read them by invoking the signal, whenever the value is changed, angular keeps the subscription and re-renders the page 
But if we use signals in the code ts part, eg, constructor, the value isnt updated automatically

```js 
contsructor() {
  console.log(this.currentStatus())
}
```
to read changes in those values, we can use the effect function.

```js 
contsructor() {
  
  effect(() => {
    // console.log(this.currentStatus())
    // angular automatically sets up a subscription. 
  })
}
```

to do clean ups, 

```js 
effect((onCleanup) => {
  const tasks = getTasks();
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`Current number of tasks: ${tasks().length}`);
  }, 1000);
  onCleanup(() => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  });
});
```

For loop, we have first, last, odd, even, count as variables available within the loop.

[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-tjnj99?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts)

Using alias 

```js 
input.required({ alias: 'data', transform: (val) =>  transformedValue })
output({ alias: 'closeTicket' })
```

If we need to make 2 way binding ourselves, 

```js 
@Input() size!: InputSize;
@Output() sizeChange = new EventEmitter<InputSize>(); // name should be same ending with "Change"

// and in template

<input [(size)]=""  />


// for 17.2+ 
size = model.required<InputSize>() // makes it 2 way bindable
size().width & size().height in template 
use set/update from ts file.

```

## Directives 

- Attribute & Structural directive 
- Enhancements for elements ( built in or components ). They can change properties, attributes, styling or behavior of elements. 
- eg: adding  ngModel to make it bindable 
- they have no templates.
- components are directives without templates.
- ngModel brings in some classes on the DOM. 
- @if is angular 17+ 
- *ngIf is a structural directives. 

[Code example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-hjzdi1?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts)

For situations where, we have a directive with some functionality that should be incorporated by other directives or components. 

in app.component.ts 

```js 
@Component({
    host: {}, // if the below directive takes inputs, we can pass it through here.
    hostDirectives: [LogDirective] // no matter how often we used this component anywhere in the application, it always add the directive onto it.
})
export class AuthComponent {

}
```

### Transformations with Pipes.

- for transforming the way data is displayed.
[Example code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-91d985?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts)

- Set pure: false if we need to make pipes run again when needed. 

### Service & DI 

- Revisiting Services, DI, Hierarchial Injectors, DI Resolution process, Injection tokens & Values. 
- DI is a built in feature which says - components, directives, services can request dependencies they rely on & they are provided by angular. 
- we dont create instances by ourselves, but we request the, and angular creates & passes them back.

```js 

// MyService is the Injection token used by angular to identify the thing it should create and inject
constructor(private mySvc: MyService) {

}
```
- we invoke the signal so that angular sets up subscriptions behind the scenes. 
- we outsource reusable logic into services.

```js 
tasks = computed(() => {
    switch(this.selectedFilter()) {
        case 'all':
          return this.svc.allTasks();
        case 'open':
          return this.svc.allTasks().filter(t => t.status === 'open')
        default:
        return this.svc.allTasks()
    }
})
```
- providedIn root makes angular aware of the injectable services. 
- null injector and errors out.
- platform environment injector (third)
- app root environment injector (second)
- module injector (second)
- emelement injector ( component reaches out first here to request a dependency)

### To provide a service 

```js
// main.ts 
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [MyService]
})
the above is same as `providedIn: root`. But it does not allow tree shaking. 

// Provide service via Element injector 
closely tied to components and directives. 
in component, we can have a providers: [] array. So the service will only be available to that component and its children. 

// Inject service into service 
we can add them into the constructor of a service, but make sure the injectable decorator is there. 
if we dont provide the injector, then we need to register the same within the bootstrapApplication configuration.
components & services reach out to element injector, services doesnt. They are not elements, they are not part of the DOM. 
They only have access to the environment injector or modules. 
```

### How is injectable values registered?

```js 
providers: [TaskService]
providers: [{ provide: TaskService, useClass: TaskService }]


export const TaskServiceToken = new InjectionToken<TaskService>('tasks-service-token')
providers: [{ provide: TaskServiceToken, useClass: TaskService }]

// in component 
taskService = inject(TaskServiceToken)

// if constructor format
constructor(@Inject(TaskServiceToken) private svc: TaskService)

// Non class value for injection 

export const TASK_STATUS_OPTIONS = new InjectionToken<Task>('task-status-options')

export interface Task {
    value: string;
    taskStatus: 'string;
    text: string;
}
export const TaskOptions: Task = [
    { value: "open", taskStatus: 'OPEN' , text: 'Open'},
    { value: "in-progress", taskStatus: 'IN_PROGRESS' , text: 'In Progress'},
    { value: "done", taskStatus: 'DONE' , text: 'Completed'}
]

// in component 
providers: [
    { provide: TASK_STATUS_OPTIONS, useValue: TaskOptions}
]


taskOptions = inject(TASK_STATUS_OPTIONS);

```

## Change detection mechanism

- we do not interact with it directly mostly.
- how do we interact & how it works internally, how do we optimize it. how change detection changes with signals and is related to zone js?

- change detection happens behind the scenes automatically. 
- we can do few things to improve it though 
- Angular wraps the entire tree with zone which is a feature provided by zone js.  
- This library detects events happening within the application and for those events which ha sa listener setup, angular runs it. 
- It will not run for any random event happening anywhere on the page if no one is listening. 
- When change detection process starts, it visits all components in entire app , takes a look at all templates there & its bindings & checks if there is a new value for it.
- If so, the real DOM is updated with new value. 
- Angular change detection runs twice when something changes, and that happens in development only. 
- Detect unwanted value changes after change detection was run. ( like retuning Math.random() from a getter property)

To opt out of zone js watch mode ,

```js 

private zone = inject(NgZone);

this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
    // whatever logic.  avoids zone pollution. 
})
```
OnPush can be turned on a component basis. `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` 

- component will change only if an event occured within its sub component tree.  
- if input changes
- if manually triggers change detection. 

## OnPush & Services

- Service has a property which is exposed as a read only signal. 
- If we use a non signal property, it becomes a problem. To manually trigger them, 

```js 
private cdRef = inject(ChangeDetectorRef);
private destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

ngOnInit() {
    const sub = this.messagesService.message$.subscribe(() => {
        this.cdRef.markForCheck()
    })
    this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => {
        sub.unsubscribe()
    })
}


// in services, have a BehaviorSubject 

messages$ = new BehaviorSubject<string[]>([])
addMessage() {
    this.messages$.next(this.messages)
}
```

Async pipe can be used to handle subscription. So instead of subscribing manually, use the async pipe in template. 
if we only use signals, we can remove zone js. 
Remove from angular.json, build => polyfills: ['zone.js'] entry need to be removed. 

In main.ts, 

```js 
import { provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';

bootstrapapplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()] // disables zone js 
})

```
Observables are values over time. Signals are values in a container. 
Observables are great for managing events & streamed data. 
Signals are great for managing application state. 

// signal to observable 
toObservable(this.clickCount)

// observable to signals 
interval$ = interval(1000)

// does auto clean up subscription 
intervalSignal = toSignal(this.interval$, {
    initialValue: 0
});

## HTTP requests 

```js 
// need to register the module first. 
providers: [provideHttpClient()], or main.ts 

bootstrapapplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideHttpClient()]
})

private httpClient = inject(HttpClient)

ngOnInit() {
    this.httpClient.get<Person[]>('url', {
        observe: 'response' // events
    })
    .pipe(
        map(() => )
    )
    .subscribe({
        next: (response) => {
          //response.body?.places
        }
    })
}
```

catchError can be used in the pipeline to catch errors.
catchError((err) => throwError(() => new Error('custom message')))

interceptors 

```js 

function logInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn) {
    console.log("intercepted..")
    const request = req.clone({
        headers: req.headers.set('X-SOMETHING', 'ddasda')
    })
    return next(req).pipe(
        tap({
            next: event => {
                if(event.type === HttpEventType.Response){
                  // event.status, event.body
                }
            }
        })
    );
}

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([logInterceptor]))]
})

// class based 

import {
  HttpEvent,
  HttpHandler,
  HttpInterceptor,
  HttpRequest,
} from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
 
@Injectable()
class LoggingInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, handler: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    console.log('Request URL: ' + req.url);
    return handler.handle(req);
  }
}

providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    withInterceptorsFromDi()
  ),
  { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: LoggingInterceptor, multi: true }
]
```

## Forms 

- 2 ways of handling forms 
- reactive forms, template driven forms. 

```js 
// FormsModule 

ng-pristine ng-invalid ng-touched 

<form #form='ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(form)">
// store control object that is created under the hood by angular for this input in this template variable.
  <input #email='ngModel' required email  ngModel name="email"/>

   
  <input ngModel required name="password" minlength="6"/>
  <button> Go </button>

  @if(email.touched && email.dirty && email.invalid) {
    <span> email Error.. </span>
  }

  @if(email.touched && password.touched && form.form.invalid) {
    <span> Error.. </span>
  }
</form>

private form = viewChild.required<NgForm>('form')
private destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

constructor() {
    // register a fn that should be executed once, once the component has been rendered for the first time.
    afterNextRender(() => {

        const savedForm = window.localStorage.getItem('saved');
        if(savedForm) {
            // parse and get email 
           setTimeout(() => {
             this.form().controls['email'].setValue(savedEmail)
           }, 1)

            this.form().setValue({
                email: '',
                password: ''
            })
        }
      const sub = this.form().valueChanges?.pipe(debounceTime(500)).subscribe({
        next: (value: any) => console.log;
      });

      this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => sub?.unsubscribe())
    }) 
}

onSubmit(formData: NgForm) {
 if(formData.form.invalid) {
    return;
 }
 
formData.form.reset();

  // formData.form.value.email, 
}

```

With reactive forms, 

```js 

//ReactiveFormsModule 

<form [formGroup]="form">
 <input [formControl]="form.controls.email"/>
  <input [formControlName]="password"/>
 <input />
</form>


function mustContainValidationFn(control: AbstractCOntrol) {
    if(control.value.includes('?')){
       return null; 
    }
    return {
      noQuestionMark: true
    }
}


function emailIsUnique(control: AbstractCOntrol) {
    if(control.value !== 'test@example.com') {
       return of(null)
    } 
    return of({ notUnique: true})
}

form = new FormGroup({
    email: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email]),
     email: new FormControl('', {
        validators: [Validators.required, Validators.email]
     }),
    password: new Formcontrol('', {
        validators: [Validators.required, mustContainValidationFn],
        asyncValidators:[emailIsUnique]
    })
})

ngOnInit() {
    this.form.patchValue() 
    this.form.setValue()
    // needs to do destroyRef too. 
    this.form.valueChanges.pipe(debounceTime(500)).subscribe({
        next: value => {}
    })
}

onSubmit() {
   this.form.value.email, this.form.value.password 
}

```

### Routing 

```js 

app.routes.ts 

export const routes: Routes = [
    { path: '', component: NoTaskComponent },
    { path: 'tasks', component: TasksComponent },
    { path: 'users/:userId', component: UserComponent }
]

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())]
})

imports: [RouterOutlet]

<router-outlet/>
```
- regular links are not allowed. It refreshes the page. 
- use routerLink which blocks the default anchor functionality

```js 

imports: [RouterLink, RouterLinkActive]
<a routerLink="/tasks" routerLinkActive="selected"

<a [routerLink]="['/users', user().id]" routerLinkActive="selected"

// set by angular.
userId = input.required<string>();

privtse svc = inject(UserSevrice);



{{ userName() }}
userName = computed(() => this.svc.users.find()).name

```

to get hold of dynamic path values, with help of inputs if we enable withComponentInputBinding
alternative way is to DI ActivatedRoute 

```
// use destroyRef too. 

activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe({
    next: paramMap => {
        this.svc.users.find(u => u.id === paramMap.get('userId')) 
        
    }
})
```
Nested routes 

```js 

{
    path: 'users/:userId',
    component: UserTasksCOmponent, 
    children: [
        { path: '', redirectTo: 'tasks', pathMatch: 'prefix' // or full }
        { path: 'tasks', component: TasksComponent }
    ]
},
{
    path: '**',
    component: FallbackComponent
}


relative 

routerLink="tasks/new"

access parent route data from child 

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding(), withRouterConfig({
        paramsInheritanceStrategy: 'always'
    }) )]
})

now, we can use input to get the data 

to go back, ../ use this. 

router.navigate(['/users', this.userId(), 'tasks'], {
    replaceUrl: true
})

// redirect users 

activated route vs snapshot 

routerlink="./" stay where I am 

[queryParams]="{order: 'asc'}"

if input binding enabled, 
order = input<'asc' | 'desc'>()

[queryParams]="{order: order: order() ==='asc' ? 'desc': 'asc'}"


export const resolveUsername: ResolveFn<string> = (activatedRoute, routerstate) => {
  const svc = inject(UserService)
  return svc.users.find(...)
}

{
    data: {
        message: 'hello'
    },
    resolve: {
       username: resolveUsername
    }
}

message = input.required<string>()

onInit=> activatedRoute.data.subscribe()

{
  resolve: {},
  runGuardsAndResolvers: 'always' // paramsOrQueryParamschange
}
