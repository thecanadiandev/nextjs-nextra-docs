# Dynamic components 

Are components which are created dynamically at runtime. Eg: an alert / modal / overlay on specific conditions.

- Create a regular component 
- It is not always there in DOM, but injected based on conditions.
- We can use `*ngIf` if we want. 
- These components are loaded by us through code.
