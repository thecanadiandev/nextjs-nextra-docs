# Angular optimizations 

- Module is a way of bundling angular blocks together.
- Component + Directive + Services + Pipes are all registered to a module as a bundle.
- Angular needs atleast 1 module.
- We can create separate Modules and import them ( non lazy) & via routers ( lazy )
- Make sure you know the angular bootstrap flow.
- The moment we import module into imports of other, its loaded instantly.
- Leaner modules are recommended.
- FeatureModules can help split the app into smaller focused module.
- we need to use RouterModule.forChild() instead of forRoot.
- BrowserModule (used only once in the AppModule), CommonModule needs to be added at the rest of the feature module.
- SharedModule can be shared across multiple modules. Add the shared  components, directives, pipes, services etc here. Export them with exports: []
- All we need is to export it, import the SharedModule and add them into the imports: []
- Dont register components in multiple modules.
- CoreModule - to make the app module leaner.
- The services which we have registered in the providers array of AppModule, and if we havent provided the providedIn: root, create a core module, 
- add a `@NgModule` within which add the providers array, and all its entries here.  Import CoreModule into AppModule.

### Lazy loading 

[Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-53guqv?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fcontact%2Fcontact.module.ts)

- use LazyLoading based on requirements only. It comes with its own code overhead.

### Pre loading lazy loaded module

```js 
 RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes, { preloadStrategy: PreloadAllModules })
```

If a service is provided to an eagerly loaded module, its available app wide as a single instance.
If its provided in a lazy loaded module, then it is available only within that module.
Never add services in an eagerly loaded module.
