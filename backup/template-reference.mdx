# Template / Local reference 

Also known as Local references.
Simply put, we need to grab an element in the component's template.
Note: What we are grabbing is the reference of the element itself. 

All we need is to put a template ref using a "hash" and it can be put in any HTML element.

and then, we have access to the local reference anywhere in the template.
We can pass them into function parameters if we want.
or we can use the `ViewChild` to handle them programmatically.

```js 
<input
      type="text"
      #userInput
      (input)="onInput(userInput.value)"
    />
```

### Getting access to template ref or DOM in code 

We have another way to grab template refs in class file programmatically.
That is through queries or "view queries"

```js
@ViewChild('userEmailRef') userRef: ElementRef;
```
Here, we say, hey i have a view query which is of type "ElementRef" 
If there is a TemplateRef with a name of **userEmailRef** in the template of this component, then we need access to that element. 

#### Another key point: 

- There is something called life cycle hooks ( which we will get to learn soon)
- From the time a component is created, to the time it is destroyed, and in between when it is updated, different methods are triggered in an order. 
- To keep it simple as of now, `constructor` is called when the component is about to be created, then comes `ngOnInit` which indicates that the component is ready. But at this point, only the class portion is ready, not the template portion. So we need to wait till `ngAfterViewInit` to get access to the template in our class code.
- If we need access to TemplateRef in `ngOnInit` for whatever reason, then we need to adjust our query by adding "static" as an option. 

```js
@ViewChild('userEmailRef', {static: true} ) userRef: ElementRef;
```

#### Content projection 

- we pass data in between the component's opening/closing element 
- we can select slots into which we can send specific content
- if we need to access them in OnInit, set static to true.
- `@ContentChild('contentParagraph', {static: true}) paragraph: ElementRef;`

### Important: 

Life cycle hooks play a huge role when it comes to accessing templates. 
For `ViewChild`, we need to wait till `AfterViewInit` life cycle hook, and for `ContentChild`, we need to wait till `AfterContentInit` hook to access the values from them. Before that, it will be undefined.
