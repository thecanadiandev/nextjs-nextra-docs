# Types of Bindings in Angular

We have 4 types of bindings

By binding, we mean, a connection or a communication between template, which is the HTML  & class / business logic, which is the Typescript logic.

- **String interpolation**. ( if we have any expression that can result in a string, use this )
- **Property binding** (HTML element attributes / properties like alt, src, href , etc can be bound dynamically, or [innerHTML]="expression")
- **Event Binding** ( click, keyboard events, mouseevents )
- **2 Way binding** ( for which we need FormsModule with [(ngModel)] or "banana in a box syntax")

### Note:

- String interpolation and property binding is from the class to the template. ie, (one way binding).
- Event binding is when user interacts with template which updates the class . (This is also one way binding, but opposite direction )
- Two way binding is, as the name suggests , bi-directional ( also called Banana in a box )
- `$event` is a reserved keyword that passes the event data as a parameter when triggering event bindings.
- By default, `event.target.value` returns a string. It is not angular related, but javascript specific.
- Property or attribute binding ( Property binding wants to target properties, not attributes. So things like aria tags need [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal")

- [Bindings Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngdocs-01?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html)
- [Angular 18 version here ](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nhpith?file=src%2Fmain.ts)

- Note: To get this 2 way binding feature, make sure, we need to register the `FormsModule` which we have imported from respective namespaces.

- like this:

```js
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [FormsModule],
})
```

- by registering the same within `imports:[]` array, we unlock all the features provided by the forms module.
- With standalone, we register them within the imports array of components. Not modules. 
- we also made the button dynamically disabled using the property binding
- so whenever the description is empty, the Accept button is disabled.

### Another option / variation for [(ngModel)] 

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngdocs-01-uva4zf?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html)

- The only difference is that, we bind to the `input` event of textarea and the value property.
- `$event` is a reserved keyword that passes the whole event object into the handler method
- so every time, we type in a new character, it is kept in sync by assigning the target value to the option object's description property.

### Adding a custom component ( v18 )

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-rtytcw?file=src%2Fapp.component.ts)
- Here, we saw the Input and Output flow as well.
