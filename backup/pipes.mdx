# Pipes 

- Allows to transform output in the template. 

[Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-waegqk?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html)

### Pure & impure pipes 

We loop over a collection to show some item. We have an input which filters them.
Whatever user typed is filter string. We need to iterate over array and check if an object with that string filter exists.
Filtering works, but if we add a new item while filter is applied, it wont be applied to the filter. 
It is not a bug. It is intentional. Angular doesnt rerun the pipe on the data whenever the data changes.
Changing the pipe input triggers a recalculation, but changing data doesnt.
Else angular would need to re-run the pipe when any data on the page changes, which costs performance. To force it to do otherwise, set pure to false.

[Example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-mh2u8p?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html)

```js
@Pipe({
  name: 'filter',
  pure: false
})

```

### Async pipe 

- Can be used by having a ` myData$ | async ` if we need to subscribe to an observable and pull the value of it without explicit subscriptions.
