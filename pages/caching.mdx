# Caching

## Understand and configure caching

- Request memoization: Next stores data requests with same configuration to avoid duplicate data fecthes. Cache only persists during request duration
- Data cache: Stores & reuses fecthed data until it is revalidated. This is to avoid unnecessary requests to data source & speeds up application. Data cache persists until it is revalidated.
- Full route cache: Stores the rendered HTML & RSC at build time. Avoids unnecessary HTML render cycles & data fetches.
- Router cache: managed on client side. Next stores the RSC payload in memory in browser. Ensures fast page transitions since no server request is needed.

In code, we have 2 different request from 2 different areas.

```js
// layout.js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages', {
  headers: {
    'X-ID': 'layout',
  },
});

// page.js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages', {
  headers: {
    'X-ID': 'page',
  },
});
```

We have same data source, but we got 2 logs on server, as the configurations are different.

If we get rid of the configuration, then only 1 new request will be added.
If we reload, no new requests will be sent. That is request memoization in action.

Even if we reload the page, or navigate back and forth, no new logs will be seen. That's because of the data cache. We could call `revalidatePath()` to throw away the cache, or we can configure fetch function.

As a config object to fetch, pass `{ cache: 'no-store'}`. When this request hits server, it says, this specific request should not be cached.

```js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages', {
  cache: 'no-store',
});
```

We can also use `{ next: { revalidate: 5 }}`. So reuse for 5 seconds and then send new data. Within 5 seconds, if there are requests sent, it will serve the cached response.

```js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages', {
  next: {
    revalidate: 5,
  },
});
```

## Controlling data caching

To set on a file wide basis, give the exact name as `revalidate`

```js
// property name has to be exact
// export const revalidate = 5;
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'; // same as setting { cache: 'no-store'}

export default async function MessagesPage() {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages');
  ...

  return <Messages messages={messages} />;
}
```

With dynamic set to `force-dynamic`, always refetch all the data needed anywhere in the file.

Another option to make sure data isn't cached which is recommended over the other two above is:

```js
import { unstable_noStore } from 'next/cache';

export default async function MessagesPage() {
  unstable_noStore();
  ...

  return <Messages messages={messages} />;
}
```

with this, if we have multiple components in the same page, and needs caching in some, but doesnt need in some, we can use this.

## Full route cache:

It's created and initialized at build time. If we build the app, next pre renders all the pages unless they are dynamic pages.
When we start the app, its the pre rendered page that is getting served.

If we set atleast one of the setting, either dynamic or revalidate, then the page auto disables full route cache.

We can also use revalidatePath.

- revalidatePath() - we revalidate some piece of cache on demand when we tell next js to do it.
- revalidateTag('msg') - we can assign tags to requests.

```js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages', {
  next: {
    tags: ['msg'],
  },
});
```

When revalidate the tags, any request that use the same tags will be revalidated.

## Set request memoization for custom data source

```js
// custom data source
import { getMessages } from '@/lib/messages';

export default async function MessagesPage() {
  const messages = getMessages();

  if (!messages || messages.length === 0) {
    return <p>No messages found</p>;
  }

  return <Messages messages={messages} />;
}
```

to add request de-duplication for our own data fecthing code,

```js
import { cache } from 'react';

export const getMessages = cache(function getMessages() {
  console.log('Fetching messages from db');
  return db.prepare('SELECT * FROM messages').all();
});
```

Then, it is just one request per page reload, even though there are multiple places where we use the getMessages function.
The request is cached. React cahces the returned data. Then that response is reused everywhere.

## Data cache functionality for our own data source

```js
import { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache';

export const getMessages = unstable_cache(
  cache(
    function getMessages() {
      console.log('Fetching messages from db');
      return db.prepare('SELECT * FROM messages').all();
    },
    ['messages'], // optional
    {
      revalidate: 5,
      tags: ['msgs'],
    }
  )
);

// and in component
```

to tell that the data cached is changed, we can use revalidatePath, or revalidateTag.
